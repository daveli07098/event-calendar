## [2026-05-09] — Session: Related Events + Quota Persistence + Scraper Fixes
- feat(modal): Sync button, search in FC toolbar, openEventId API fallback ([d0ecada])
- feat(search): event search dialog (Cmd+K) with keyboard navigation, no AI quota ([f19fafa])
### Fixed
- fix(quota): `remaining` was read before `incrementAiLimit` — badge always showed pre-scan count; now reads after increment ([d02893e])
- fix(quota): fallback to in-memory if DB columns not yet migrated (prevents 500 crash) ([fc3c9d3])
- fix(scrape): `ReferenceError: name is not defined` in AI provider catch block ([2e3b1e3])
- fix(diff): missing `/**` comment opener caused ECMAScript parse error in diff/route.ts ([d75c0a1])
- fix(tickets): AI quota now DB-persisted (`aiQuotaDate`/`aiQuotaCount` on User); survives dev hot-reloads and server restarts ([d75c0a1])
- fix(scrape): JSON-LD location as plain string now used directly as venue (fixes empty venue on timable multi-night events like IVE) ([d75c0a1])
### Added
- fix(mobile): DayDetailPanel as bottom-sheet on mobile ([605f755])
- feat(tickets): `GET /api/events/related` endpoint — finds events sharing the same Ticket URL across calendars ([d75c0a1])
- feat(events): EventModal shows "Related Events 相關活動" panel above description when concert ↔ ticket-sale events share a Ticket URL ([d75c0a1])
- feat(events): clicking a related event chip in EventModal switches the modal to that event ([d75c0a1])
### Changed
- feat(tickets): "Extracted by" replaced with a styled badge (blue=AI, grey=og-meta, amber=error) showing exact model name ([ab9fc90])

## [2026-05-02] — Session: Quota + Venue + Diff context
### Fixed
- fix(tickets): quota badge now fetches on mount via GET /api/tickets/scrape; always visible regardless of extractMethod ([cadbf6a])
- fix(tickets): venue field now falls back to data.location for events where AI sets location instead of venue (e.g. ZUTOMAYO) ([cadbf6a])
- fix(tickets): diff context panel now shows stored sale windows (label + date + time) for all ticket events ([cadbf6a])
### Added
- fix(mobile): DayDetailPanel as bottom-sheet on mobile ([605f755])
- feat(tickets): GET /api/tickets/scrape endpoint returns current AI quota without running a scrape ([cadbf6a])

## [2026-05-02] — Session: Quota
### Changed
- chore(quota): raise AI daily scrape limit from 100 to 250 per user ([eb2d428])

## [2026-04-27] — Session: Ticket Section
### Added
- fix(mobile): DayDetailPanel as bottom-sheet on mobile ([605f755])
- feat(tickets): AI-powered Ticket Section page for auto-importing event URLs ([b226c5a])
  - `/tickets` page — paste any ticket/event URL; AI extracts title, date, time, venue, description
  - `/api/tickets/scrape` — server-side HTML fetch (SSRF-protected) + AI extraction with 4 provider tiers:
    1. `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (free: 1M tokens/day)
    2. `GITHUB_TOKEN` — GitHub Copilot Chat API (OpenAI-compatible proxy)
    3. `GROQ_API_KEY` — Groq / Llama 3 (free tier)
    4. OG/Schema.org + JSON-LD fallback (no key required)
  - `/api/tickets/add` — auto-creates a `ticket-reminders` calendar (orange) on first use, then adds extracted event
  - Sidebar nav updated with Ticket icon → `/tickets` link

## [2026-04-27] — Session: Google sync + account management
### Added
- fix(mobile): DayDetailPanel as bottom-sheet on mobile ([605f755])
- feat(calendar): per-calendar Google sync button + unlink Google account ([bcf01e7])
  - `POST /api/calendars/[id]/sync` — re-runs full Google Calendar event import for a linked calendar; only owner can trigger; returns count of synced events
  - `GET /api/google/account` — returns 200/404 to tell the UI if Google is linked
  - `DELETE /api/google/account` — unlinks Google OAuth; clears `googleCalendarId` on all user calendars; permanent but reversible via reconnect
  - RefreshCw icon button per Google-linked calendar row in Settings (spins while syncing, shows synced count in alert)
  - GoogleCalendarImport card: persistent "Google Account linked / No Google Account linked" footer with Unlink / Connect buttons; replaces old static text + error-only reconnect button

## [2026-04-27] — Session: ICS export + Google account management
### Added
- fix(mobile): DayDetailPanel as bottom-sheet on mobile ([605f755])
- feat(calendar): ICS export + Google account reconnect and deduplication ([61872bf])
  - `GET /api/calendars/[id]/export` — RFC 5545 compliant ICS download (works in Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook)
    - Proper line folding at 75 chars, text escaping, UTC datetimes
    - All-day events use `VALUE=DATE` with exclusive DTEND
    - Auth-gated: owner + members can export
  - FileDown button (per owned calendar in Settings) → instant `.ics` download
  - `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking: true` on Google provider — prevents duplicate user records when same email is used for credentials + Google OAuth
  - `signIn` callback deduplication — if a Google sign-in would create/use an OAuth-only user but a credentials user with the same email exists, the Google Account is transferred to the credentials user (one canonical identity)
  - "Reconnect Google Account" button appears in Google Calendar Import card when token fetch fails — triggers fresh Google OAuth flow → updates stored tokens

## [2026-04-27] — Session: Event creation animation
### Added
- fix(mobile): DayDetailPanel as bottom-sheet on mobile ([605f755])
- feat(calendar): spring bounce animation for newly created events ([195bc39])
  - `newEventId` state tracks the just-created event for 2 s
  - `eventClassNames` callback adds `fc-event-new` to the FC event wrapper
  - `@keyframes eventBirth` — spring bounce scale-in with slight rise (cubic-bezier spring curve)
  - `@keyframes eventShine` — white ring expands outward and fades on event appear

---

- feat(calendars): Duplicate button in settings "My Calendars" section ([8e0d71c])
- fix(share-dialog): layout overhaul — separate header/body sections, `pr-12` to avoid close-button overlap, `max-h-[70vh]` scroll ([8e0d71c])

### Added (previous entries)
- feat(calendars): `/api/calendars/[id]/share` — generate share links with view/collaborative modes ([b1fdb74])

- feat(events): Event edit/delete in `EventModal`; CalendarView and settings improvements ([7aa72ec])

### Added
